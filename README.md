# Survival Analysis

## Background

- Survival times are typically follow up times from a defined starting point to the occurrence of a given event.
- Use cases:
  - Beginning of a customer-ship to churning of that customer
  - Issue of credit card to customer to first default
  - Start of an insurance policy to it's first claim
- Standard statistical techniques do not apply because the underlying distribution is rarely normal and the data are often "censored"
